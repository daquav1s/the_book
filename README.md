# the_book
This is my a repository to display my projects when I was working through [**The Rust Programming Language**](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/), which is a phenominal book!

The projects this repository will feature are:
- A simplistic number guessing game.
- A generic command-line program.
- A multithreaded web server.

This is my first step to becoming a backend developer with Rust!
